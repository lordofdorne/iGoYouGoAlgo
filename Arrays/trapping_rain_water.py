# Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
# Example 2:

# Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
# Output: 9
