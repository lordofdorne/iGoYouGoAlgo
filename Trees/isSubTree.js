// Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly the same structure and node values with a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a tree consists of a node in s and all of this node's descendants. The tree s could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

var isSubtree = function (s, t) {
  if (!s) return !t;
  return isEqual(s, t) || isSubtree(s.left, t) || isSubtree(s.right, t);
};

function isEqual(root1, root2) {
  if (!root1 || !root2) return !root1 && !root2;
  if (root1.val !== root2.val) return false;
  return isEqual(root1.left, root2.left) && isEqual(root1.right, root2.right);
}

// O(N*M) where N is the size of tree and M is the size of subtree (we're iterating over a subtree for each node in the main tree)
